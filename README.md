-Every HTML element is its own box â€“ with its own spacing and a border. This is called the Box Model.
-In this course, you'll use CSS and the Box Model to create your own Rothko-style rectangular art pieces.

In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas.
The content is surrounded by a space called padding, similar to how bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it.

Think of the border like the cardboard box your item was shipped in.

Apparently overflow: hidden; sets widths original values when paddings applyed out.

-   filter: blur(2px); it blur color away.
-   Margin, padding, shorthands.
